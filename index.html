    <p>Welcome to our final project webpage for COSC-225: Algorithms & Visualization. For this project, we chose to investigate 
      how to engineer and visualize a perfect snake game. In this context, perfect does not imply that this is the most efficient solution,
       but rather that the snake is always guaranteed to grow long enough to fill out at least n-1 squares of a grid of n squares (in some cases, it may
       even fill up the entire grid!). This is accomplished by calculating safe Hamiltonian cycles (whenever possible) that allow the snake to travel along the entire
      grid without self-intersecting itself, where the cycles are dependent on the grid dimensions. Here is some useful informatiom regarding user interface functionality:   </p>
      <ul class="description" id="p2">
        <li>The user may set the speed of the snake within the "Snake Speed" text box, and click the neighboring button to aply the change.</li>
        <li>The user may set the width and height of the grid (in squares) using xWidth and yWidth, then resize it using the button.</li>
        <li>Clicking "Step" illustrates a single step of the algorithm, moving the snake by one square along its path.</li>
        <li>Clicking "Animate" illustrates each stage of the algorithm at regular intervals until it terminates.</li>
        <li>Clicking "Reset" removes all apples and snakes from the grid and clears the Snake Speed, xWidth and yWidth input text boxes.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>More information on our algorithmic approach is available <a href="Exposition.html">here</a>!</p>
